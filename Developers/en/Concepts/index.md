Most modern applications look more or less like this:

### The most common interactions are: 
- Browsers communicate with web applications
- Web applications communicate with web APIs (sometimes on their own, sometimes on behalf of a user)
- Browser-based applications communicate with web APIs
- Native applications communicate with web APIs
- Server-based applications communicate with web APIs
- Web APIs communicate with web APIs (sometimes on their own, sometimes on behalf of a user)

Typically each and every layer (front-end, middle-tier and back-end) has to protect resources and implement authentication and/or authorization â€“ often against the same user store.

Outsourcing these fundamental security functions to a security token service prevents duplicating that functionality across those applications and endpoints.

Restructuring the application to support a security token service leads to the following architecture and protocols:

Such a design divides security concerns into two parts:
